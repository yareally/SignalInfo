NOTE: Contacting me without reading the BUILDING file first will result in being ignored. Especially if it's about building the project in any IDE other than Intellij IDEA (especially Eclipse).
Gives you all the available information for the CMDA/GSM/LTE Signal on your
Android Device. Not all information may be available depending on the OEM/OS
version of the device.
I don't consider all of the code to be entirely "idiomatic Scala" due to performance considerations on Android
and also time needed to refine the code to be less "Java like."

However, the code is still more concise and I give some examples of how to cut down
on some of the Java noise by using techniques such as implicits for anonymous Java methods:

    implicit def pageChangeLambda(funct: (Int) => Unit) = new ViewPager.SimpleOnPageChangeListener {
        override def onPageSelected(position: Int): Unit = funct
    }

    // usage below:

    mViewPager.setOnPageChangeListener {
        (position: Int) => actionBar.setSelectedNavigationItem(position)
    }

I do accept pull requests if you ask nicely. Also translations to other languages
are welcomed if you want to commit the files to me replacing the strings. All
strings for the user interface are abstracted out of the design, so easy to change.

Anyone interested in translating, create an account at Transifex (https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/advanced-signal-info/).
From the project I created there, you can see what needs translated and add it there so I can update it in the code. If the language
you wish to translate to is not listed, just let me know and I can add it.

Actual app can be found on the market: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cc.signalinfo

Sometimes I will update it in the repo here under the root, but don't count on it being up to date.
